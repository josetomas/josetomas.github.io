								<p>AUTONOMOUS DEVICE FOR PV PANEL CLEANING</p>
							</header>
							<p>Inti-Tech is a robotics company that has been developing an autonomous robot fleet for solar panel maintenance. These robots reduce the inefficiency of photovoltaic electrical generation due to soiling. In order to accomplish this, the robots clean the panels solving key industrial challenges such as: water scarcity in desserts, existence of an standar geometry for solar arrays, and extremely rough environment due to high temperatures and radiation. I worked with them for one and a half years, starting in 2017. </p>		
							<p><b>My contribution</b> for this start-up was centered in the design and development of an on site tested product ready for mass production. During the period I worked in this company we advanced from a "proof of concept" (image in the left) to a commercial product (image in the right). Currently, this version is being mass produced and installed in different solar farms in Chile.</p>

							<p>I worked in the development of different expriments:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p> <a href="https://www.dictuc.cl/">DICTUC</a>: The certification institute of <a href="https://www.uc.cl/">Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile</a>,where the company  certificate that the robots increased the solar panels efficiency.</p>
								</li>
								<p><b>My contribution</b> to this experiment was the development of hardware and firmware that enabled the remote control of the robots at a first stage, and a final control system for its autonomous control. 
								</p> 
								<li>
									<p><a href="https://www.laborelec.com/">Laborelec</a>: The research institution from the electric generation company <a href="https://www.engie.com/en">Engie</a>. The company conducted an on site pilot in the solar farm <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Planta+Solar+Camarones/@-18.8882985,-70.1138936,1174m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x91503dc87aad5d5f:0xb59fc36e8ae09d12!2sMinera+pampa+c%C3%A1marones+S.A.!8m2!3d-18.9118042!4d-70.2175338!3m4!1s0x91503e593b7865cd:0xb84490a9fb1d5f0c!8m2!3d-18.8882001!4d-70.114732">"Pampa Camarones"</a>,  located near the city of Arica, Chile in the middle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert#Comparison_to_Mars">Atacama Dessert</a>, a extremenly tough enviorment; it is the driest desert in the world, has extremly high solar radiation levels, and thick soil that damages mechanical systems. This characteristics have make this enviorment comparable to Mars <a href="https://www.explorers.org/flag_reports/Flag_52_-_J_Judson_Wynne_Flag_Report.pdf">[1]</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031119114044/http://amesnews.arc.nasa.gov/releases/2003/03_87AR.html">[2]</a>      
									</p>
								</li>
									<p>The objective of this experiment were:</p>

									<ul>
  									<li>Test how robots will behave in such an extreme enviorment.</li>
  									<li>An accelerated aging test, that simulated 10 years of use in 6 month.</li>
									  <li>Test if the cleaning system installed in the robots produced "micro cracks" in the solar panels.</li>
									  <li>Test if a real increase in the solar panel array eficiency was produced by this cleaning method.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><b>My contribution</b> to this experiment changed within its scope of it. Before the experiment started I was part of the team that developed the mechanical structure of the robot and it's charging station. This challenge includes an adjustable pressure system for the brush that is unique in the world. During the experiment I was in charge of design of the solution to the mechanical problems the robot faced on site. I also went to work directly in the solar farm. </p>
