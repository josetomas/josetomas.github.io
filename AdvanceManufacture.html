								<p>ADITIVE MANUFACTURE FOR NATURAL FIBERS</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								With the goal of developing novel biodegradable composites for additive manufacture. A team formed by José Tomás Domínguez, researcher at <a href="http://fablab.usm.cl/">Fab Lab UTFSM</a>, and MIT PhD(c) <a href="http://palomagr.mit.edu/">Paloma Gonzalez</a>, with the collaboration of the R&D department of the chilean forestry <a href="https://na.arauco.com/">Arauco</a>  studied the development of biocomposites materials that could be used in a 3D printer. 
							</p>
							<p>
								These composites were looking to enable the incorporation of wood based materials such as wood pulp, lignin and wood ashes to new manufacturing trends. The project aimen to develope biodegradable materials, wich keeped ous from the development of a wood based filament. </p>  

								The project's first objective was the development of a whole system that enabled the incorporation of this raw materials into the additive manufacture industry. This system was formed by 3 parts:   
								<ul>
									<li>A viscous material  extrusion system.</li>
									<li>A slicing system that considered this materials printing capabilities. 
									</li>	
									<li>And material formulas that tested the printing capabilities of wood Pulp, and forestry organic waste such as lignin or wood ashes.  </p>	
								</ul>			
							<p><b>My contribution</b> to this project at the beginning was centered on the development of the extrusion system for commercial 3d printers. This system had to have the adaptability to work with fibers, different rhaeological properties of the material. After the system was working, my work center on defining the material physical, rhaelogical and mechanical conditions in order to be printable.  During the scope of the project I was more immersed into the material development, being that my principal task at the end. </p>
							<p>The following videos shows the first print of each material, showing that the formulas worked for 3D printed systems.</p>

									Wood pulp first print. A material formula that enabled the was developed. Even its rough superficial quality. A new extruder design was developed to get better qualities.

									Wood Ashes first print. A material formula that enabled the was developed. This shows that rough materials could be incorporated in the process, giving the final material more stifness.

									3D Print, Lignin + Wood pulp. This material formula incorporated a rough material (lignin), to give the finishing part more stifness, and fibers (wood pulp) that gives the material more strength.
